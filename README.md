# lwa-tools

A collection of missing tools to aid processing data generated by LWA stations.
LSL is required for some, and can be installed as a [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nsbruce/lsl).

To install, clone this repo, cd to this directory, and run `pip install .`. Add
a `-e` flag to make it editable if you're changing the library code. Once
installed, it should be available using `import lwatools`. Most of the code
also works as scripts that you can call directly from your shell, but they
require the library to be installed in order to run.

Due to some quirks in LSL, one of this library's dependencies, numpy must be
installed in order to install `lwa-tools`. If installing this library fails,
run `pip install numpy` and try again.
